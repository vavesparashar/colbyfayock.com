Finally inspired in love, I have decided to share one of the best tomatoes recipes from the lands of India. 

A very popular dish along the great Ganga planes, the recipe differs from home to home. Maa cooks a bit differently using many spices for a rich taste.



The recipe as described by my sister is below:



1. Put kadhai(Pan) on the stove üî•

2. Add 4-5 teaspoons of Mustard oil - highly recommend using mustard oil for original taste.

3. [Panch phoran](https://www.daringgourmet.com/panch-phora-indian-five-spice-blend/) ( mix of 5 spices)

4. 1 bay leaf and 2 whole red chilli

5. Mix it for 10 sec. Here is a [video](https://imgur.com/CvtduUN) for your reference on how it will look 

6. Add chopped tomatoes 

7. Add jaggery 

8. Add sugar 

9. Lil bit salt 

10. Half teaspoon turmeric 

11. 1 teaspoon garam masala/dhaniya masala 

12. Pour some water according to the need 

13. Cook tomatoes properly. We need viscous texture.



The final result should look something like this:

Sweet Sour üçÖ chutney ready.



All the ingredients can easily be bought online or at an Indian grocery store. 



Like any other chutney, you can have it with bread, rice or just as rich favour during lunch/dinner. 



Also, sugar acts as a preservative so the tomato chutney can easily last 7+ days and longer in the refrigerator.
