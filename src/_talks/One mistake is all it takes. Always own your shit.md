Initially it feels daunting how can i be responsible all the times. 

But soon you realize, it becomes a habbit.

You are the creator of the life you want. 

> You fucking own it. 

Stay honest to yourself and believe you can do it. 

Who else will? Entire responsibility of universe is to fall on the lap of a man. 

No one cares, it is a thankless job. But you always say, it is easy. 

You are the god, who is born to live like a king. 

Enjoy motherfucker.

Cheers,
H
