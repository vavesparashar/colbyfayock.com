Cultivate your energy. 

It is special & unique. It is your seed. 

Let is be stored for a while. Forget everything else.

Girls, Work, Career, Money - All these are very important and essence of life itself.

But You come first. Don't drain it. 

From this seed, A plant will blossom, Flowers will come but atleast take the first step of cultivating the energy. It is everything. 

**Do anything you want but cultivate. - Rule 1**

Might as well add healthy benefits for faster results. Ever wondered why people recommend hitting the gym? It is because it accelerates the result. So, choice is yourself. 

**You set the pace. So, mindful of it. - Rule 2**

Also, You can add some art for expression. This life is expression. You can paint, sing, pick up 'that' instrument, teach, learn a skill - 

**All these will form a way to express what is going inside you and how you see life itself. - Rule 3**

By virtue of this energy, You will attract all kind of things you desire or want in life. See - Your seed is natures gift. It is so powerful that it can produce 5 billion humans at once. That's almost entire human race. Just from one ejaculation. 

**Think of it! Rule 4**

It is the very essence which produced giants like Jesus, Mohammad, Buddha among others. Cultivate it. 

**Let the lotus blossom. ðŸŒ·**
