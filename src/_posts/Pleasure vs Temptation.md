Pleasure is outside. Ex: You crave sex. One of the greatest pleasure. 

Temptation is inside. Ex: You desire power. 

These two things take away the focus of a man. 

A purpose can never be found in pleasures and temptation. As all will be taken away in due time. 

Mission should be to focus on something absolute. Else pangs of life makes one nihilistic as one gains experience. 

What is absolute? This is the question where all your answers lie. 

Meditate upon it. 

Is there even an absolute? Question the basics. 

Have patience. 

Dare to explore cosmic timescales. 

Theory like big bang is good but does it add to your quality of thinking. 

Mostly these are baggage people carry in name of knowledge without realising making life stressful. 

A star loses the shine when named. 

Explore the mystery. 

If there is absolute, go with purest of pure emotion. 

Give your everything in its pursuit. 

There is a reason why faith has been called a virtue. Practice it. Believe. 

Have such strong convictions where even mount Everest crumbles to the ground. 

Great acts can only be accomplished
