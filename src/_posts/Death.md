Ultimate question any philosophy asks. 

It would be unfair to claim to help people without answering the most basic questions which had led to different stream of thoughts. 

I don't know what death is. But i definitely think that is a limitation on human potential. 

Limitation not just in physical dimension, but also in thoughts and vibrations. 

It has always been preached to look death as your ultimate nemisis. 

I propose a thought that considers death as nothing more than a happening. Much like breathing, don't over think it. 

We wish to cultivate thoughts that lead to finest creature in the entire universe. Such pristine and natural thoughts. 

As if, entire universe manifested itself to experience life. 

A human mind that is fearless and bold is what we aim to achieve. 

For such thoughts to hold any value, concept of death needs to be forgotten. 

Work as if you will live forever. Then only greatest work of all time can ever be accomplished. 

Such courage. Such high-level thinking will help in generation of energies which are extremely important to a mind as sharp as humans. 

There is a reason why Humans are called the smartest beings on earth. 

It is not just because of civilizations we have created, on that basis there are thousands who ruled earth for longer period of time. 

Smartest beings on the virtue that only human beings are capable to identify their animalistic trait and master it by it's brain. 

For ex: Only a human of all animals can stop all sexual desire at will. 

No animals can resist. My cat goes wild during heat. 

Having control of emotions is not the goal, but understanding what a person am doing is driven by animalistic needs or not, is what is paramount.

Another interesting way to put the same idea is only humans diet at will. You won't ever see any other animal dieting. 

Basic desires definitely needs attention otherwise survival instincts will never leave you alone. 

Food. Shelter. Clothes. 

I think anything more than these are non-essential. 

Rendering sexual, physcial, financial thoughts as animalistic endeavours an intelligent mind can ever pursue. 

Issue that arives later with these pursuits are fear will consume a person. As all desires orginate and end in death. 

Death is ultimate blackhole. 

Creativity in its essence is darkness. All revolves around fear/death. 

If a human mind can somehow stop this idea of death, a lot more potential is exposed as now you have unhinged yourself from a collar of death. 

Universe is again a wild ride where things can happen and be manifested. 

It have heard stories of men flying, getting bigger at will, arms having strength of 10,000 elephants. 

Such ideas seems inconviceiable to current humans. Again limiting themselves thought by thought. 

Which bring me to, don't call your pursuit a hobby.
