Science states Humans are most intelligent species on the planet. Some dare to say, in the universe. 

Courtesy of this intelligence, Humans have dominated lands of earth. 

However, When we state humans are most intelligent species on earth we mean human mind is capable of perceiving highest of highest thoughts. 

As it said, You are what your thoughts and they decide our actions and actions decide where we end up in life. 

Hence, Focusing on thoughts in a good start. 

Thoughts can be of many type. Few have classified them as per quality 

>  Person < Things < Idea

Idea has gained highest value. 

So, Thoughts about ideas are of high value. 

If we go deeper into idea, how can we refine it even more?

An idea which helps a human achieve highest potential. 

A thought which helps you feel positive, energetic, loving, kind, gratitude, heroic, courageous, brave will go a long way in achieving the human potential. After all, we are talking about the most intelligent mind in the entire universe. 

I don't say these are the only things required but for any great act, these are necessary thinking process. If you don't have the courage, how will you even dare to explore the vastness of the human potential. 

I have read about Buddhist monks who can control their body temperatures at will and bodybuilders who can lift over 500kg weight. 

Such are the possibilities of human potential. 

All these require self-belief, courage, strength. Hence, my initial premise of highest thoughts stands corrected. 

Going deeper, What else will highest thought constitute off?

Most widely accepted theory about origin of universe is big bang theory. Everything out of nothing. As magical as it sounds, science doesn't have much explanation to this. They call singularity, everything culminated into a single point and it burst out. 

If science can dare to entertain such ideas, I too think possibility of magic and superpowers into my highest thoughts.

Highest thought will have a divine element as well. Tender yet most powerful, soft yet most hardened, love yet most fearful. 

So, It all culminated into one simple idea -- A idea that helps you feel divine will be the highest idea to focus on. 

This idea will help you achieve all the greatest possibilities of human potential. 

For practical purpose of job, making money, being a father or a lover, If you're so strong, powerful, loving -- it is given that you will excel at all these. 

Please keep in mind, i don't talk of delusion. My narrative is to find the object of focus which helps you attain the best of best life. Dare I say, Most intelligent mind should be living the most highest form of life. 

My advice to every human on earth is a simple idea. Focus on the idea of feeling divine. 

Feel, not just reading and speaking. It must manifest into something real as well. 

All the gaints of history, ask to focus on something similar. 

They have name for it i.e. GOD

But due to political tendency of human society, such terms assume a very vague defination which doesn't hold real life signification. It is this reason why in modern world, woke concepts doesn't validate existence of god. They understand there is a higher force but no names given. It is almost mysterious and face value is asked to be accepted. 

I think it is garbage idea to waste way the immense potential of human mind. If it is the most intelligent mind in the universe, why waste it by focusing on political things.

Have a clear focus. Sharp. 

The idea that all the giants speak off is the same. Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, Mohammad -- All said the same thing. However, due to language translation issues face value remain but essence is lost. I ask you to dump these. These are unnecessary baggages you are carrying. 

Life is simple. 

You have a human mind. Whatever you will focus on will sprout, grow, become a beautiful tree where fruits will ripe. Be it career, finances, lover, family -- these are all good. But when time tests the strength of these, all crumble to nothing. 

Highest idea should be daring death itself. Is there something that exists beyond death as well?

Something which was present before death, will be after death, exists here with me, exists there with you. 

Is that thing time?

Time is present everywhere. During life, after death, it is with me. It is with you.

But some scientist claims, there are objects in the universe where time cease to exist. They are called blackholes. It is a singularity. Nothing but a single point. 

Time being a dimension curtsey to Mr. Einstein, is not the answer. Keep looking. 

Highest idea is something universal. 

This constant search is what scholars in past have called the truth. The idea which is true everywhere. I have read the theory but still these are mere mental ideas which are worthless baggage unless they are manifested for real. 

Keeping aside these, My take is simple. 

Focus on exploring the highest idea. The idea that is true everywhere. The idea which helps you feel infinite, limitless, deathless. 

Such constant focus will definitely result in all the good things in life and then some. 

But till then, focus. Focus as if your entire potential depends on it. 

Yours truly,
